# Arduino_Serial_Touchscreen_Tester

This project was compiled and written using the Visual Micro Plugin (http://www.visualmicro.com/) on Visual Studio 2017.

This is for flooding serial input for stress testing JMP (https://www.jmp.com/en_us/home.html) realtime graphics abilities.

For use with Adafruit 2.8 TFT Touch Shield for Arduino (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1947).

Make sure you install the "Required Libraries" otherwise the build will fail. You can still open "Arduino_Serial_Touchscreen_Tester.ino" in the normal Arduino IDE and use the code fine, the Visual Micro plugin is not required.
